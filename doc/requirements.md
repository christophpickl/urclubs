# Top 3 reasons why to write a custom MyClubs client

1. Support of additional metadata
    * Partner can be rated, have images, notes, location, opening hours, 2/4 credits, phone number, website
    * See complete history of all visited activities
    * Custom grouping (which can be rated in general)
1. Recommendation system
    * Don't just display all activities, but rather filter based on personal preference
    * Make use of metadata (rating) to get some kind of ranking (score system)
    * Hide "bad" partners and "unwanted" categories
    * Hide activities too far away (e.g. trans-danube)
    * Proper location based search
    * Different recommendation styles, e.g.: "Exploration" - list all yoga partner's if not yet visited
1. Calendar integration
    * Only display activities which are possible due to free timeslot
    * Automatically create calendar entry (location, web address)
